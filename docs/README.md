# docs

Documentation, RFCs, architecture diagrams, and contributor guides. Store design decisions and onboarding materials here.

Suggested structure

- `docs/rfc/` — RFCs and proposals
- `docs/architecture/` — diagrams and APIs
- `docs/developer/` — dev setup, workspace guidelines, and contribution checklists

How to edit

- Write RFCs as markdown files and link them from the top-level `docs/README.md`.
- Keep docs versioned with the code when designs change.
